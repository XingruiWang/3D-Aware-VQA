## Description
This is the implementation of the NeurIPS'23 paper "3D-Aware Visual Question Answering about Parts, Poses and Occlusions". This paper contains two parts:

1. **Super-CLEVR-3D**. A compositional reasoning dataset that contains questions about object parts, their 3D poses, and occlusions. $\rightarrow$ [`./superclevr-3D-question`](https://github.com/XingruiWang/superclevr-3D-question/tree/main)
2. **PO3D-VQA**. A 3D-aware VQA model, combining 3D generative representations of objects for robust visual recognition and probabilistic neural symbolic program execution for reasoning. $\rightarrow$ [`./PO3D-VQA`](https://github.com/XingruiWang/3D-Aware-VQA/tree/master/PO3D-VQA)
