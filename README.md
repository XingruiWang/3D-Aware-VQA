## Description
This is the implementation of the NeurIPS'23 paper "3D-Aware Visual Question Answering about Parts, Poses and Occlusions". The paper contains two parts:

1. **Super-CLEVR-3D**. A compositional reasoning dataset that contains questions about object parts, their 3D poses, and occlusions.
2. **PO3D-VQA**. A 3D-aware VQA model, combining 3D generative representations of objects for robust visual recognition and probabilistic neural symbolic program execution for reasoning.
